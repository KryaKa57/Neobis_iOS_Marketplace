## Description 

This is the eighth project in Neobis Club called "Mobi Market". It is MarketPlace application, where registered users can upload their products and sell there. Project turned out to be much more difficult than the previous ones, because here we create a bunch of screens with a lot creative UI elements, and which are related to each other. As in previous project, here i worked with small team: backend & frontend web developers. Project has a lot of actions: authorization (register, login & fully registration with number), profile and product manipulations (edit, delete, add and etc.).

## Getting started 

- Make sure you have the XCode version 14.0 or above installed on your computer
- Download the project files from the repository
- Install CocoaPods
- Run pod install so you can install dependencies in your project (SnapKit, Cloundinary, Alamofire is used in the project)
- Open the project files in Xcode
- Run the active scheme by using any emulator

## Usage

On first screen user will see fields and buttons to login or register. When user is new and will try to login, there will be pop-up window with message to register. Registration divides in two parts, where user gives login, email and password. Then user goes to main screen, where user can see all products in collection in two rows. User can see tap them to check more information. If user wants to add product, then user have to register fully. Add telephone number, and verificate with code, which will send to email. After that, user can delete or edit his products.

## Running the Tests

Tested all possible scenarios and checked all requests for completition, like trying to create product without price, or edit profile email.
